## Interacting with individuals from diverse cultures aided me to augment my understanding of peoples' diverse perspectives and cultures. Today, I more comfortable and confident that I can excel in any new environment. These interactions have shaped me into a more open-minded, adaptable, and versatile person and have created immense curiosity in me to explore the globe.
